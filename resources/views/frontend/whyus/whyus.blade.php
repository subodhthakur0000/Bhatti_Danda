					<li>Tamang culture and traditions are the heart and soul of the Homestay. You will be living with a Tamang family, eating Tamang food, learning about their culture and even, living their culture!
					</li>

					<li>A closer peek into the Himalayas is reason enough to visit Bhattidanda. Imagine waking up to that view! All of our rooms have a spectacular view of the mountains. Sunrise and sunsets are especially beautiful!</li>
					<li>Food served to you is locally produced by the community and directly purchased from the farmers.</li>
					<li>Liked the aloo ko achaar and the saag? Phul Maya didi will not only share her recipe, but teach you how to cook as well!</li>
					<li>If you want to get a taste of agriculture, you can follow Phul Maya didi to her field to see how crops are grown.</li>
					<li>The village in itself is very peaceful. Take a walk around trees, enjoy the tranquility, learn about the village, and interact with the local community.</li>
					<li>Despite being a small village, there are many stories and storytellers! Two elderly women aged above 80, love sharing their tales!</li>
					<li>If you love hiking, you can choose from short hikes (lasting an hour) to long ones (lasting a full day).</li>
					<li>You can participate and contribute in many community based projects during your stay.</li>
					<li>Tamang culture is best explored through its ethnic wear, dance and instruments. All of these are available in the homestay, ready for you to explore!</li>
